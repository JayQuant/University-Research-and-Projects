# University-Research-and-Projects
This is a repository containing course projects and my senior thesis at university. 

## Value versus Growth in Hong Kong stock marktets
Senior thesis supervised by Professor KWONG, Kai Sun, Sunny. Compared returns of value and growth portfolios from 2002 to 2020, using the annual rebalancing method proposed in the seminal paper by Fama and French (1998).

## Analysis of GameStop Squeezes
Course Project for **ECON 4450 - Economics of Derivatives**. The project focuses on explaining the dynamics of short squeeze and gamma squeeze. Moreover, evidence is suggested that the second rally was primarily led by a gamma squeeze, not a short squeeze. I was responsible for covering entire sections regarding the short squeeze and gamma squeeze.

## Game Stop Equity Report
Course Project for **ECON 3350 - China HK & the World Economy**. This was a project-centric course, where students were given the autonomy to submit as many projects as they could during the term. I was responsible for completing sections regarding business evaluation, potential catalysts, and valuation of Game Stop using a weighted method incorporating DCF and multiples (EV/EBITDA, EV/Sales) approach.

## Excess CAPE Analysis of Hang Seng Index
Course Project for **ECON 3350 - China HK & the World Economy**. At that time, Professor Robert Shiller had recently published a [paper](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/making-sense-of-soaring-stock-prices-by-robert-j-shiller-et-al-2020-11), in which he justified higher broad market valuation ratio by using the ECY framework. Basically, unlike the CAPE ratio, ECY incorporates bond yields and so essentially gives a measure of risk premium of stock market over the long run risk free rate. Using this novel approach, I analyzed the Hang Seng Index using the ECY framework.
